# NumPy Playground ðŸ§®

## My Journey Learning NumPy

This repository documents my learning path and practice exercises with NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

## What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It's the foundation for data science and scientific computing in Python.

## Learning Goals

- Master array creation and manipulation techniques
- Understand broadcasting and vectorization for efficient computations
- Learn statistical functions and linear algebra operations
- Apply NumPy to solve real-world data problems
- Explore integration with other scientific libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib)
